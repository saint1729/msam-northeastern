    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "<font size='4'> In this assignment you will practice putting together a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classification pipeline. So far we have worked with deep fully-connected networks, using them to explore different optimization strategies and network architectures. Fully-connected networks are a good testbed for experimentation because they are very computationally efficient, but in practice all state-of-the-art results use convolutional networks instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size='4'>In this module, you will implement several layer types that are used in convolutional networks. You will then use these layers to train a convolutional network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",

    "* <font size='4'>Do not install any additional packages inside the conda environment. The TAs will use the same environment as defined in the config files we provide you, so anything thatâ€™s not in there by default will probably cause your code to break during grading. Failure to follow any of these instructions will lead to point deductions. \n",

As proposed in the original paper [1], batch normalization can also be used for convolutional networks, but we need to tweak it a bit; the modification will be called \"spatial batch normalization.\"\n",

    "<font size='4'>Normally batch-normalization accepts inputs of shape `(N, D)` and produces outputs of shape `(N, D)`, where we normalize across the minibatch dimension `N`. For data coming from convolutional layers, batch normalization needs to accept inputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and produce outputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` where the `N` dimension gives the minibatch size and the `(H, W)` dimensions give the spatial size of the feature map.\n",

Given a 2D feature map with shape of `(N, C, H, W)`, the mean across the dimension `H` and `W` are computed.
