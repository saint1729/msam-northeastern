    "## Overview\n",
    "<font size='4'> In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the SVM/Softmax classifier and simple fully-connected networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font size='4'>understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)\n",
    "- <font size='4'>understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- <font size='4'>implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier\n",
    "- <font size='4'>implement and apply a two-layer neural network classifier\n",
    "- <font size='4'>implement and apply an arbitrary-layer neural network classifier\n",
    "- <font size='4'>understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers\n",

    "* <font size='4'>Do not install any additional packages inside the conda environment. The TAs will use the same environment as defined in the config files we provide you, so anything thatâ€™s not in there by default will probably cause your code to break during grading. Failure to follow any of these instructions will lead to point deductions. \n",
