# CS 5330 programming assignment 4: Softmax, SVM, and Fully-Connected Neural Network


# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command, Modify the command based on your OS (`linux`, `mac`, or `win`): `conda env create -f pa4_env_<OS>.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs5330_pa4'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs5330_pa4` in the Windows default Command Prompt or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs5330_pa4` or `source activate cs5330_pa4`
4. We have two parts in this assignment. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook ./pa4_code/linear_classifier.ipynb` and `jupyter notebook ./pa4_code/fc_net.ipynb` and finish tasks described over there.
5. You are strongly suggested to start with the `linear_classifier.ipybb`. For `fc_net.ipynb`, we assume the data downloading has been finished.
6. Submit your finished Jupyter notebook files to Canvas.
